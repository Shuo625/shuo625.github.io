Because ubuntu enables secure boot, the system will require you to set a password for enrolling a MOK(Machine-Owner key) if the MOK is not enrolled during the installation of nvidia driver.

Enter the same password again to confirm the password.

Reboot the system and then enroll MOK.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

During rebooting of the system, you should choose ==Enroll MOK > Continue > Yes > Enter Password(You have set earlier) > Reboot==.

After the system reboot, validate the version of nvidia driver.

```
